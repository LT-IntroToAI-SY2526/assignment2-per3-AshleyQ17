# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
What was difficult for me while completing the math function was that when you would complete a step you would need to do the next one and sometimes when you would complete a step it would make some of the asserts not work right, all of the steps relied on each other for all of the asserts to work which I think was hard.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You could use the math function for extracting information from a movie database because the math functions check if the pattern matches the source, you can extract infromation from a movie database using this because the math function can check if the information about the movie matches what's in the database.
